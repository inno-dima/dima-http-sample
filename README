You have to:
* refactor the code using your own style to make it as _simple_ and _maintable_ as possible
* test with automated tests
* add a configuration file for the static content path and the listening port
* add gzip compression support
* add dynamically generate directory view (similar to the classic apache folder view: https://www.apache.org/dist/ )

To complete the project, you can 
* use internet resources
* use java default libraries only (junit being the exception)
